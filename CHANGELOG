Version 2.2 (77ac7ebd0e86c9027112ead934e22916f79a4367), July 25 2014
  + Use the naive switch-case solution to implement RAM operations when
  that solution is cheaper than Merkle-tree based solution

  + Add two new APIs: ramget_hybrid() and ramput_hybrid() that automatically
  switches between the naive solution and the Merkle tree based solution
  using DB_THR_NUM_ADDRESSES_NAIVE in pepper/flags  

  + Add examples: apps_sfdl/ram_hybrid_micro.c and
  apps_sfdl/ram_merkle_micro.c
