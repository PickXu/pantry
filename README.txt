I. Installation
  
  This codebase requires the following dependent packages. Get in touch
  with us if you face issues (see the contact information below)

  1. gmp with C++ extensions enabled
  2. PAPI
  3. Chacha pseudorandom number generator (use the assembly version for
  high performance)
  4. NTL with NTL_GMP_LIP=on 
  5. libconfig
  6. Cheetah template library
  7. OpenMPI
  8. CUDA packages (if you would like your installation to use GPUs,
  which would require setting USE_GPU to 1 in the makefile)
  9. GMPMEE 
 10. go
 11. python
 12. OpenSSL
 13. fcgi
 14. PBC (from Stanford)
 15. ant
 16. boost
 17. LevelDB
 18. KyotoCabinet
 19. libzm (from https://github.com/herumi/ate-pairing.git)
 20. Java (1.7 or higher)

II. Configuration

  - To select different verifiable computation protocols (Zaatar,
    Ginger, Pinocchio, etc.), please see common/utility.h
  
  - The compiler generates two types of constraints depending on the
    value of FRAMEWORK in the makefile
    
    - FRAMEWORK should be set to ZAATAR for using Zaatar's and
      Pinocchio's verification machinery.

    - FRAMEWORK should be set to GINGER to use ginger's verification
      machinery.

III. Running examples
  
  (1) With a single machine, for testing purposes.

    Suppose the computation is pepper/apps_sfdl/mm.c, then
    use the following commands.

    cd pepper
    ./run/run_pepper.sh mm
    
    (Note: The first time a new computation is compiled, the above
    command will fail with "No target to compile ... _p_exo.o". In that
    case, re-run the above command and it should work.)
    
  (2) With a cluster, for experiments.

    Please refer to

    for launching a job on TACC. 

IV. What is new in this version?
  
  (1) a better implementation of RAM operations in Pantry by adapting
  ideas from TinyRAM
    
    - For an example of this, see apps_sfdl/fast_ram_test.c

  (2) an implementation of TinyRAM
      
    - For details, see tinyram/doc/
